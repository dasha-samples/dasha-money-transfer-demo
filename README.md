This example shows how to build an interactive flow that includes processing user input with entites and interaction with database (users_db.json file). If you need any help, join us in our [Developer Community](https://community.dasha.ai).

## How to start the demo app

1. Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dasha-samples/dasha-money-transfer-demo
cd dasha-money-transfer-demo
npm ci
```

2. Create or log into your account using the Dasha CLI tool:

```sh
npm i -g "@dasha.ai/cli"
npx dasha account login
```

3. Run one of the following:
    * To start outbound call run
    ```sh
    npm start <phone_number>
    ```
     (phone number in international format without `+`, for instance `12223334455`).

    When you run with phone_number, app searches for the user with this phone in the database. Make sure that you have this phone in the database.
     
    * To start text chat run
    ```sh
    npm start chat <user_id>
    ```
    * For this example, `npm start chat 1`

    When you run with user_id, app searches for the user with this the phone is id.
